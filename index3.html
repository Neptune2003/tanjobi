<p class="content">Hey my wifee!
  I hope you are having the best day. I miss you soooooo much. Damn I have accumulated so many nicknames for you over the years: sneaky, snocky, div, liv, libby etc. You can see my exact thought process as you read through them. And I’m still the smart one of the group (JK, we all know its you). 
  Damn! You’re 22 now (oooffff.. so old)!. It feels like just yesterday we were in the 11th grade, trying to catch sleep between (during) classes while simultaneously taking notes (god we were nerds). We have been there for each other all these years, never a quiet day in the 
  Slytherin Commonroom and you are a constant in my life that I know I will never lose. I am so glad that we are a family, I can't imagine my life (or just a day) without you
  Your one and only true love (suck it Nandan) <br>

  <div class="card">
  <p class="content"> Divya, I do not know you as well as I would like to sadly though we spent summer in same lab, but from our limited interaction (and from what loads Nandan has told me about you), you genuinely 
    seems like an angel embodied, the sweetest, kindest, coolest, funniest, smartest, amazingest person. 
    <br> I wish YOU the bestest of the best on this auspicious day of your birth and well, pull and meet up more often, exchange lore and lets bully Nandan some!! xD.

Hey Divya,
<br>This is a little something for one of the most sensitive and empathetic souls I know. You're not just fun to be around, but someone who truly understands people at their core. I’ve really cherished every conversation we’ve had, no matter how brief—it’s always been meaningful. 
<br>Our shared love for books? Absolutely unmatched. Your passion for what you enjoy, and how expressive you are about it, is something I genuinely admire. Through our talks, I’ve learned a lot about myself too, and I’m incredibly grateful for that.
<br>You have this way of making everyone around you feel comfortable, and I’ve always felt that warmth from you. You're wholesome in the best possible way, and I just want to thank you for being you. 
<br>Wishing you the happiest birthday, filled with everything you love. And remember, I’m always by your side—your fellow microexpression noticer (Aru, of course).

All the love~

    I think we first got to know each other through Kavya, but when I really bonded with you was our audio tech course. 
    I honestly loved working with you(can never forget those late nights) and am glad we passed that course😮‍💨. 
    And I think I came across your fun side during the AT nite. You are the most kind, hardworking and smart person I have come across. 
    You also have a butt load of patience which I really admire🙇‍♀🙇‍♀. 
    A person with such qualities definately has an AMAZING life ahead, be assured. Just remember to stop and have fun sometimes😜.
    You have always been there for me😭🫂(hope I can count on you in the future too🥹), and I want you to remember you can always contact me, 
     for anything and at anytime too(who knows if we'll even end up in the same time zone). I feel extremely lucky to have met you🫂🫂🫂

        My rescuer for everytime I’ve bunked, couldn’t have understood anything without your notes. 
        Also cheers to corner house after capstone celebrations and to all those capstone meetings and standing as a barrier between yogi and me before we rip each other apart, 
        your energy and patience kept us going, and I’ve always admired how you handled everything with such grace. I’m so grateful for our friendship,

    We haven't had much interaction, except having half of our names common. 
    <br> But I would like to thank you for providing your notes from which literally the whole 2025 ECE batch studied.
    <br> We don't know how many student passed, how many students remembered and solved questions just because they went through your notes! 
    <br> You've contributed a lot to our section and our branch unknowingly and have helped alot of us in many ways. 
    <br> Having your notes in the drive link I created for our batch was an honour! It'll be maintained like a legacy as it'll be passed on to juniors. 
    <br> Thank you for making B section proud, and helping everyone unknowingly. <br> Happy Birthday once again :)

    <br>I remember our linear algebra project which is when i first worked with you i think, where you practically carried the whole thing while I... well, I think I was just there for moral support👉🏻👈🏻. 
    <br>The fashion advice you gave related to anime merch shopping and also stickers, my god! you are god🙏🏻. 
    <br>From visiting HPE to few tumkas in AT, I will cherish those memories. 
    <br>And I’ll definitely be praying (and hoping!) that those goddamn kids will finally start listening in your TA classes—seriously, they don’t know how lucky they are to have you! 
    <br>They will realise soon enough you are The Divya whose notes will be in their survival kit.😗 
    <br>Hope your day is fun-filled, you deserve it all! 💘

    I’ve always looked up to you as someone who is so dedicated and patient and sweet and amazing and the most unique incredible person I’ve come across in my life. 
    Our friendship is a pretty basic one but I consider it more because of the impact you’ve made. I don’t say it lightly when I say Thank you so much for unknowingly making me better. 
    You are the one person I would wish to have a happy blessed life. From listening to my banter to helping all of us out with our studies, you are irreplaceable. 
    If there’s anyone I would never forget from my engineering it would be you. 
    I will forever cherish our memories from the classroom to Aatmatrisha to just randomly chatting during our capstone meets. Cheers to having a happy 21 and many more!! Will miss you a lot after graduation!!

    <p class="content"> Hi Divya , Wassup how's it going , did you know you were the first friend I made in B section as soon as I got shifted and although you might have thought of me as a nuisance ( which I was sorry and thank you very much) , 
      you helped me out and were really patient with me and seriously helped me in the beginning of 3rd sem when no one ( like 0 people were ready to lend me a hand to adjust with ece) that is something that I'm always going to keep in my heart . That kindness of yours , that warmth , I knew you were a gem since day 1 🥰. 
      Thank you for listening to me non stop and really just being there for me in times when some really never found out if anything was wrong. Thank you for baring with my absurdness and I'm glad you always took the randomly uncomfortable situations I put you in like a SPORT ( YOU DA G) 
      And at last you probably know that my Gpa would have easily been -2 of what it is if not for your notes. It's a genuine skill you have here . I hope you flourish and grow into your strengths and more .
      Love you maxxx , ever so grateful to have met you 💗💗

      <br> We had talked a few times, and our first encounters were a bit awkward, but I found you a quite intriguing person.  
      <br>I soon saw that underneath all that cover lied a person who had their priorities straight (at least from outside) and was dedicated to all the things that mattered to them. 
      <br>I saw how you played by your strengths, with quiet self confidence and 0 cockiness that is indeed so admirable!!
      <br> I have also noticed that you have a way of putting people at ease in personal conversations with your non judgemental way of looking at things  and that makes you so beautiful. 
      <br>Hope you have a wonderful year ahead filled with Love, Laughter and Liveliness club mommy!!

Wishing you a very happy birthday Divya!!!<br> You are one of the very few people who accept me in RR campus (was a alien here for sometime 😅).
<br>First time we properly talked was on the day you had helped me with the matlab codes of Mathematics for electronics engineers in 3rd sem. That act of yours made me feel that I am no more an alien here in RR campus.In the upcoming semesters, we collaborated on research projects, where I got to know your skills more.We worked day and night (sometimes burnt the midnight oil) and came with solutions to problems initially thought as impossible.The most profound memory I have is when we working for the hackezee hackathon project and we randomly entered the scooter parking for the license plate recognition where we search for the best license plate and had a lot of fun !!Who can forget your notes, those are the golden contributions to ECE dept!!!
Enjoy your day and keep smiling!!<br><br>
